# Code of Conduct
**Note: This code of conduct is designed to provide: a) a simple, easy to understand, minimal code of conduct without ambiguity; b) that is designed for what is important; and (c) to focus on getting stuff done.**

## Scope
**This code of conduct applies to on-topic development channels of the project. This
includes but is not limited to:**
- Bug trackers
- Development repositories
- Mailing lists
- Non-development platforms if misbehavior is also applicable to development channels
- Any other communication method for development of software

**Off-topic channels are subject to their own rules and guidelines.**

## Standards of Communication

**We expect all users to stay on-topic while using development channels.**

**We will not accept the following:**

- Stalking and witchhunting
- Arguments, and off-topic debates
- [Ad hominems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)
- Attempts to flame, or otherwise derail communication
- Troll feeding

***If you see misbehavior, ignore the person(s) and speak with a moderator or administrator in [Illinois_Roadbuff's Discord server](https://discord.gg/sd4XfAqNF9), or contact Illinois_Roadbuff directly via email: [< illinois_roadbuff@proton.me >](mailto:illinois_roadbuff@proton.me).***

We are here as human beings to contribute to the free, open source / open content world. Treat others with decency and respect. Beyond that, contribute freely.
